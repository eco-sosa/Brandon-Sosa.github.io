# Research Portfolio

My work bridges marine ecology, environmental economics, and restoration science to develop practical solutions for coral reef conservation in South Florida and the Caribbean.

## Research Themes

### **Marine Restoration Ecology**

**Caribbean Reef Restoration Interventions** | *Biotic Intervention Lead*  
Leading international working group developing recommendations for advanced coral restoration strategies across the Caribbean through the Reef Futures Workshop.

Marine Grazer Research | *Lead Researcher*
Investigating how Caribbean King Crabs and long-spined sea urchins enhance coral restoration success through dynamic modeling, socioeconomic analysis, and mariculture experiments.

Coral–Crab Restoration Project | *Collaborative Researcher*
Restoring corals alongside stocking crab grazers, while monitoring impacts on reef health metrics such as fish abundance, benthic composition, and coral outplant survival.

**Marine Sponge Research** | *Collaborative Researcher*  
Testing physiological and environmental stressors on marine sponges to understand their resilience and ecosystem role under changing conditions.

### **Environmental Economics**

**Everglades Economic Valuation** | *Research Consultant*  
Contributing to comprehensive economic valuation of the Greater Everglades system, developing benefit-transfer approaches and stakeholder engagement strategies. [View Report](https://b797e412-2757-4f33-af72-a0f87d5b59ea.usrfiles.com/ugd/d45609_d489ae3e21024e3da5e8024227993854.pdf)

**Florida Socioeconomic Reef Survey ** | *Lead Researcher*  
Designing surveys to understand public perceptions and willingness-to-pay for marine restoration interventions to inform policy and communication strategies.

**Florida Coastal Everglades LTER** | *Collaborative Researcher*
Investigating the benefit–cost ratio of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), evaluating how large-scale restoration initiatives impact ecosystem services and provide long-term returns for communities and the environment.

### **Toxicology & Fish Biology**

**Fish Toxicant Meta-Analysis** | *Lead Researcher*  
Comprehensive meta-analysis examining bioaccumulation and maternal transfer of mercury and PCBs in freshwater fish, focusing on impacts on offspring survival and growth. (manuscript submitted 9/2025 *Fish and Fisheries*)

## Research Impact

My interdisciplinary approach combines rigorous science with economic analysis and social science methods to develop restoration strategies that are ecologically effective and socially feasible. This work directly informs management decisions and policy recommendations for coral reef conservation in South Florida and the Caribbean.
