:::{#hero-heading}

I'm Brandon Sosa — an aspiring marine ecologist and environmental economist. Currently, I am a PhD candidate working to optimize coral reef restoration. My research bridges ecological fieldwork, economic valuation, and dynamic modeling to support large-scale reef recovery, in the Florida Keys. I focus on the practical use of marine grazers like urchins and Caribbean king crabs to reduce algae and boost coral success.

I was mentored by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oAfxdvAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Butler</a>, 
whose pioneering work in marine invertebrate ecology shaped my early ecology and academic foundation. I am now co-advised by 
<a href="https://myweb.fiu.edu/bhatm/" target="_blank">Dr. Mahadev Bhat</a>, an environmental economist specialized in natural resource management, and <a href="https://www.tropicalfishecologylab.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Alastair Harborne</a>, a coral reef ecologist focused on fish-habitat interactions and reef resilience.


Outside the field, I’m passionate about science communication, ecosystem service valuation, and building tools that connect research to real-world decisions. Ask me about rock climbing, hiking, video games, snorkeling, SCUBA, or my pets!
