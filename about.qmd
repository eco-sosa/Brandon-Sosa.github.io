I'm Brandon Sosa — a Cuban-American marine ecologist and PhD candidate working to optimize coral reef restoration. My research bridges ecological fieldwork, economic valuation, and dynamic modeling to support large-scale reef recovery, especially in the Florida Keys. I focus on the practical use of marine grazers like urchins and Caribbean king crabs to reduce algae and boost coral success.

Outside the field, I’m passionate about science communication, ecosystem service valuation, and building tools that connect research to real-world decisions.

## Education

**Florida International University**, PhD in Environmental Science (In Progress)  
**University of Queensland**, Study Abroad, Marine Biology (2019)  
**Purdue University**, B.S. in Aquatic Sciences (2018)

## Experience

- Coral restoration research with NOAA, FIU, and the Mission: Iconic Reefs initiative  
- Social and economic survey design for marine ecosystem valuation  
- Mariculture experiments in abandoned saltwater quarries  
- Speaker and mentor in ecological economics and marine science workshops
