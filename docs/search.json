    "text": "I’m Brandon Sosa — an aspiring marine ecologist and environmental economist. Currently, I am a PhD candidate working to optimize coral reef restoration. My research bridges ecological fieldwork, economic valuation, and dynamic modeling to support large-scale reef recovery, in the Florida Keys. I focus on the practical use of marine grazers like urchins and Caribbean king crabs to reduce algae and boost coral success.\nI was mentored by Dr. Mark Butler, whose pioneering work in marine invertebrate ecology shaped my early ecology and academic foundation. I am now co-advised by Dr. Mahadev Bhat, an environmental economist specialized in natural resource management, and Dr. Alastair Harborne, a coral reef ecologist focused on fish-habitat interactions and reef resilience.\nOutside the field, I’m passionate about science communication, ecosystem service valuation, and building tools that connect research to real-world decisions. Ask me about rock climbing, hiking, video games, snorkeling, SCUBA, or my pets!\n\n\nFlorida International University, PhD in Environmental Science (In Progress)\nUniversity of Queensland, Study Abroad, Marine Biology (2019)\nPurdue University, B.S. in Aquatic Sciences (2020)\n\n\n\n\nReef restoration research with NOAA and FIU in support of Mission: Iconic Reefs initiative\n\nSocial and economic survey design for marine ecosystem valuation\n\nMariculture experiments in abandoned saltwater quarries\n\nSpeaker and mentor in ecological economics and marine science workshops"
